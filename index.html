        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This game generates board with cells, each containing one of the
            symbols: ♠, ♥, ♣, ♦. When user clicks on a cell, it deletes the cell
            as well as any of its neighbors with the same value.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two modes to play the game: using terminal with default
            and random values and user interactive, where you can choose the
            values.
        </p>

        <h2>User Interactive Mode</h2>
        <p>To run user interactive mode, navigate to live page.</p>
        <code>
            &#9888; This is light version of the game and does not provide
            visualizations yet. Use Dev Tools to see logs.
        </code>
        <p>
            Once the page loads you will see prompts, which will ask to input
            number of rows and number of columns for the table. After that, you
            will be asked if you want to continue playing. If you choose to
            continue, you will be asked to select row and column of the cell
            coordinates to click. Otherwise, the game is finished.
        </p>
